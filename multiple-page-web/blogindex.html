        <p>Testerday, a post I had submitted to Hacker news got pushed up to the front page. Outside of retiring and
            basking in my new-found internet fame, I wanted to show what a few hours on the front-page looks like.

        <h2>Home Made Standing Desk raspberry Pi Controller</h2>
        <p>One of my lockdown projects was to make my sit/stand controller smart. I used a Raspberry Pi to create a
            custom controller that could control the motor on my desk and allow me to rise and lower it over the
            network
            as well as via a touch-interface.</p>

        <h2>Saving Your Initial Reaction</h2>
        <p>This is very simply idea that has helped me in a number of different ways in the recent past:recoding my
            initial reaction to things. All this means is immediately saving my thoughts on atopic somewhere, as
            opposed
            to the usual... "i'll write this dowm later".</p>

        <h2>Sending Ember actions down to components</h2>
        <p>"Data down, actions up" is an often reapeated mathra of the Ember community, and for good reason.
            Sometimes
            though, you need to call actions on components in a "downward" direction. In this post I'll give you an
            approach for breaking this DDAU rule.</p>

        <h2>"Route variable" pattern with Ember</h2>
        <p>There are couple of different libraries fo Ember that add the ability to set the page title for each page
            title for each page in your application by simly creating a 'title' property on each route.This is a
            great
            general purpose pattern for declarative information that needs to be set across routes. For example you
            might want to add breadcrumps, or just a different heading on each page. This post will outine how to go
            about creating this pattern yourself. </p>
