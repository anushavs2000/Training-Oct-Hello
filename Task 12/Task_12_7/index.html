                    <h2>Piping and plumbing fittings...</h2>
                    <p>Pipes are commonly joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing a connection 
                        with  a pipe thread compound, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually 
                        joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld.
                        The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep which is typically 
                        at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accomodate the filler weld metal.

                        purposes. A broad variety of standardized [pipe fittings are available; they are gennerally
                        broken down into either a tee, an elbow, a branch, a reducer/enlarger, or a wye. Valves control fluid flow 
                        and regulate pressure. The piping and plumbing fittings and valves articles discuss them further.

                    <h2>Cleaning...</h2>
                    <p>The inside of pipes can be cleaned with a tube cleaning process, if they are contaminated 
                        with debris of fouling. This depends on the process that the pipe will be used for and the 
                        cleanliness needed for the process. In some cases the pipes are cleaned using a displacement 
                        device formally known as a Pipeline Inspection Gauge or "pig".
