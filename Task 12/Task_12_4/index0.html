                <h2>Protogonist</h2>
                <p>The protogonist is likely a pretty familiar concept for most of us: this is the main character,
                    the big cheese, the star of the show. Most of the actions centers around them, and they are the 
                    one we're ment to care about the most.
                    In stories written with the first person point of view, the protogonist is usually the narrator
                    can also be some close to the MC or someone completely removed.
                </p>

                <h2>Antagonist</h2>
                <p>If you're an antogonist, you antagonise - it's what you do. Specifically, you undermine, thwart, battle, 
                    or otherwise oppose one character: the protogonist.
                    Most of time, the protogonist is good and the antagonist is evil, and such is the source of their conflict.
                    This is not always the case- especially if the protogonist is an anti-hero who lacks typical heroic attributes,
                    or the antagonist is an anti-villian who has noble characteristics.

                <h2>Deuterogonist</h2>
                <p>Most stories have a primary protoginist and a secondary deuterogonist. This is a character who'
                    not exactly in the spotlight, but pretty close to it.
                    The Deuterogonist's comic book equivalent would probably be the sidekick. they're often seen
                    in the company of the protogonist giving advice, plotting against their rivals, and generally
                    lending a helping hand

                <h2>Tertiary Characters</h2>
                <p>The reason that tertiary characters are'nt called "tertagonists" is because they are'nt important enough
                    to really agonise anything or anyone. They flit in and out of the MC's life, perhaps only appearing in one or two scenes 
                    throughtout the book.

                <h2>Love Interest</h2>
                <p>Most novel contain romance in one from or another. It might be the main plot, a subplot, 
                    or just a blip on the narrative radar - but no matter how it features, there has to be some sort
                    of love interest involved. This love interest is typically a deuterogonist, but not exclusively.

                <h2>Confidant</h2>
                <p>The one's even harder to pin down, especially since many stories focus so much on their MC's love 
                    interest that other relationships get left out in the cold. However, the confidant can still be one 
                    of the most profound relationships the protogonist has in a novel.
